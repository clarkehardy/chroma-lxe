# This file was generated by config_from_stl.py
#
# Description: This file is used to define the geometry of the detector.
#             The geometry is defined by a list of parts, each of which
#             is a separate STL file. Each part can have its own material
#             properties, and can be marked as a detector or not.
#
#             Colors are specified in hexadecimal format, with the alpha
#             channel as the first two digits, followed by red, green, and
#             blue. I.e., 0xAARRGGBB.
