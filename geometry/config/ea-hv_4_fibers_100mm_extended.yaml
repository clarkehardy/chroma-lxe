# This file was generated by config_from_stl.py
#
# Description: This file is used to define the geometry of the detector.
#             The geometry is defined by a list of parts, each of which
#             is a separate STL file. Each part can have its own material
#             properties, and can be marked as a detector or not.
#
#             Colors can be specified in hexadecimal, e.g. 0x00ff00 for green,
#             as a string, e.g. 'green', or as a uint32, e.g. 0x00ff00ff for
#             green with full opacity. All matplotlib colors are supported
